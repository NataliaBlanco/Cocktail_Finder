# Natalia's Cocktail list üç∏
In order to use this repository you will need to clone into your device. The page itself allows you to search for a list of cocktails and also to save them in a "Favourites list".

If you would like to see and play with the code, you will have to clone the repository. Once cloned you will need to 
install on your pc the package running in your terminal following command 

"npm install". 
Then, in order to see the page you will have to run the command "npm start" and the page will show up.

The objective of this exercise was to practise JS concepts and issues as well as working with Sass & HTML and to be able to build a dynamic page from scratch.

There is a creative side to the project as the design of the page is genuine and exclusive.

There is a link to the website on githubpages on the right top handside of the page.

All you need to do is type in the name on the dialog box that is shown under the title and click on the search button on the left hand side. 
After pressing the button a list containing the desired search will appear and then you will be able to select your favourite cocktails by clicking into the card. A beautiful pink colour will show the selected card and will add it into a list on the left hand side.

One of the benefits of the page is that no matter how many times you refresh your page you will still be able to your favourite cocktails.

Once no longer you would like to keep you favourite cocktails listed, you will only need click on the 'X' icon on the left hand side and they will dissapear  

Have fun selecting those drinks! :partying_face:
